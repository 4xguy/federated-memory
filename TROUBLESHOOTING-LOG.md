# Production Deployment Troubleshooting Log

## Issue
Production server on Railway fails health checks with "Service Unavailable" despite working locally.

## Debugging Progress

### ‚úÖ CONFIRMED WORKING
1. **Ultra-minimal server** (just Express + health checks) - WORKS
2. **Minimal server** (from earlier session) - WORKS
3. **Minimal + Database connection** - WORKS
4. **Minimal + Database + Basic middleware** (logger, CORS, Helmet, JSON parsing) - WORKS
5. **Minimal + Database + Middleware + Redis** - WORKS

### ‚ùå CONFIRMED FAILING
1. **Full server with all services** - FAILS
2. **Full server with defensive initialization** - FAILS
3. **Minimal + Database + Middleware + Redis + Session/OAuth** - FAILS ‚ö†Ô∏è FOUND THE ISSUE!

### üîç COMPONENTS TO TEST (in order)
- [x] Express server with health checks only
- [x] Database connection (Prisma)
- [x] Basic middleware (logger, CORS, Helmet, JSON parsing) - WORKS
- [x] Redis connection - WORKS
- [ ] Session middleware + Passport/OAuth - TESTING NOW
- [ ] Passport/OAuth initialization
- [ ] Module system initialization (Registry, Loader, CMI)
- [ ] REST API routes
- [ ] MCP routes
- [ ] Error handling middleware

### üìù FINDINGS
1. Basic Express server works in production
2. Database connection works in production
3. Basic middleware (logger, CORS, Helmet) works in production
4. Redis connection works in production
5. **Session middleware + Passport/OAuth FAILS in production** ‚ö†Ô∏è
6. The issue is with OAuth/session initialization

### üéØ NEXT STEPS
Found that session/OAuth causes failure. Testing:
1. Session middleware alone (without Passport) - TESTING NOW
2. If session fails, check RedisStore issue
3. If session works, isolate Passport initialization issue

### üí° CURRENT HYPOTHESIS
The failure is likely in one of:
- Module system initialization (ModuleRegistry, ModuleLoader, CMI)
- OAuth/Passport initialization
- Redis connection (though it's supposed to be non-blocking)
- One of the API route handlers

### üìå IMPORTANT NOTES
- We already tried disabling modules and it still failed, suggesting the issue might be in middleware or route initialization
- The server works locally, so it's likely an environment-specific issue
- Railway health checks at `/api/health` with 60-second timeout
