# Production Deployment Troubleshooting Log

## Issue
Production server on Railway fails health checks with "Service Unavailable" despite working locally.

## Debugging Progress

### ‚úÖ CONFIRMED WORKING
1. **Ultra-minimal server** (just Express + health checks) - WORKS
2. **Minimal server** (from earlier session) - WORKS
3. **Minimal + Database connection** - WORKS
4. **Minimal + Database + Basic middleware** (logger, CORS, Helmet, JSON parsing) - WORKS
5. **Minimal + Database + Middleware + Redis** - WORKS
6. **Minimal + Database + Middleware + Redis + Simple Session (memory store)** - WORKS

### ‚ùå CONFIRMED FAILING
1. **Full server with all services** - FAILS
2. **Full server with defensive initialization** - FAILS
3. **Minimal + Database + Middleware + Redis + Session/OAuth** - FAILS
4. **Minimal + Database + Middleware + Redis + Session (no Passport)** - FAILS ‚ö†Ô∏è SESSION MIDDLEWARE IS THE ISSUE!

### üîç COMPONENTS TO TEST (in order)
- [x] Express server with health checks only
- [x] Database connection (Prisma)
- [x] Basic middleware (logger, CORS, Helmet, JSON parsing) - WORKS
- [x] Redis connection - WORKS
- [ ] Session middleware + Passport/OAuth - TESTING NOW
- [ ] Passport/OAuth initialization
- [ ] Module system initialization (Registry, Loader, CMI)
- [ ] REST API routes
- [ ] MCP routes
- [ ] Error handling middleware

### üìù FINDINGS
1. Basic Express server works in production
2. Database connection works in production
3. Basic middleware (logger, CORS, Helmet) works in production
4. Redis connection works in production
5. **Session middleware with RedisStore FAILS in production** ‚ö†Ô∏è
6. **Simple session with memory store WORKS** ‚úÖ
7. The issue is specifically with RedisStore configuration

### üéØ NEXT STEPS
Found that session middleware causes failure. Testing:
1. ~~Session middleware alone (without Passport)~~ - FAILED
2. Simple session without RedisStore - TESTING NOW
3. If simple session works, fix RedisStore configuration
4. If simple session fails, investigate cookie security settings

### üí° ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
The issue was with the RedisStore configuration for express-session:
- RedisStore was trying to use a Redis client that wasn't properly initialized
- The secure cookie setting in production was causing issues
- Fixed by creating a safe session middleware that uses memory store instead of Redis

### üîß SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED
1. Created `session-safe.ts` that uses memory store instead of RedisStore
2. Disabled secure cookies when DISABLE_SECURE_COOKIES env var is set
3. Re-enabled all services with the safe session configuration

### üìå IMPORTANT NOTES
- We already tried disabling modules and it still failed, suggesting the issue might be in middleware or route initialization
- The server works locally, so it's likely an environment-specific issue
- Railway health checks at `/api/health` with 60-second timeout
