# Production Deployment Troubleshooting Log

## Issue
Production server on Railway fails health checks with "Service Unavailable" despite working locally.

## Debugging Progress

### ‚úÖ CONFIRMED WORKING
1. **Ultra-minimal server** (just Express + health checks) - WORKS
2. **Minimal server** (from earlier session) - WORKS
3. **Minimal + Database connection** - WORKS (currently running)
4. **Minimal + Database + ??** - WORKS (you mentioned we had added two other services)

### ‚ùå CONFIRMED FAILING
1. **Full server with all services** - FAILS
2. **Full server with defensive initialization** - FAILS

### üîç COMPONENTS TO TEST (in order)
- [x] Express server with health checks only
- [x] Database connection (Prisma)
- [ ] Basic middleware (logger, CORS, Helmet, JSON parsing) - TESTING NOW
- [ ] Redis connection
- [ ] Session middleware
- [ ] Passport/OAuth initialization
- [ ] Module system initialization (Registry, Loader, CMI)
- [ ] REST API routes
- [ ] MCP routes
- [ ] Error handling middleware

### üìù FINDINGS
1. Basic Express server works in production
2. Database connection works in production
3. The issue appears when we enable the full server with all components

### üéØ NEXT STEPS
Since ultra-minimal + database is currently working, we should:
1. Add components one by one to the ultra-minimal server
2. Deploy and test after each addition
3. Identify which component causes the failure

### üí° CURRENT HYPOTHESIS
The failure is likely in one of:
- Module system initialization (ModuleRegistry, ModuleLoader, CMI)
- OAuth/Passport initialization
- Redis connection (though it's supposed to be non-blocking)
- One of the API route handlers

### üìå IMPORTANT NOTES
- We already tried disabling modules and it still failed, suggesting the issue might be in middleware or route initialization
- The server works locally, so it's likely an environment-specific issue
- Railway health checks at `/api/health` with 60-second timeout
