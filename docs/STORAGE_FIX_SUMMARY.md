# Storage Fix Summary

## Problem
When you connected Claude.ai to the Federated Memory MCP server, the API layer worked perfectly but storage operations failed with "Failed to store memory" errors.

## Root Cause
The `src/utils/database.ts` file was using Prisma's template literal syntax (`$queryRaw`) with dynamic table names, which doesn't work properly in PostgreSQL. The `${Prisma.sql([table])}` syntax was causing SQL syntax errors.

## Solution Applied
1. **Updated database.ts**: Replaced all template literal queries with `$queryRawUnsafe` and proper parameterized queries
2. **Fixed dynamic table names**: Used string interpolation for table names in the SQL query strings
3. **Maintained security**: All user data is still properly parameterized to prevent SQL injection

## Changes Made
- `storeWithEmbedding()`: Changed from `$queryRaw` to `$queryRawUnsafe` with parameterized values
- `searchByEmbedding()`: Built SQL query string manually and used `$queryRawUnsafe`
- `getWithEmbedding()`: Updated to use `$queryRawUnsafe` with parameters

## Verification
Created test scripts that confirm:
- ✅ Production database is properly configured
- ✅ pgvector extension is installed
- ✅ All memory tables exist
- ✅ Insert/query/delete operations work correctly

## Next Steps for Railway
After Railway deploys this fix (commit d606236), the storage operations should work immediately. No database migrations or configuration changes are needed.

## Local Development
For local development, use `.env.local` with local PostgreSQL settings to avoid connecting to production services.
